/**
 * Classes in this package, and the logging sub packages, are virtual copies of their counterpart classes
 * in the base MyBatis Generator code.  We need to duplicate them in the Eclipse plugin Ant runner
 * because of some complexities in plugin class loading.
 * <p>
 * Classes in the antsupport JAR are loaded by the Ant classloader - which is a child of the plugin classloader.
 * 
 * Only the Ant classloader will have the logging implementations that are added to the launch configuration
 * classpath.
 * 
 * Any class that uses one of the optional logging implementations must also be loaded by the Ant classloader.
 * If we use the versions from the base library (loaded by the plugin classloader), they will not be able to see
 * the implementation JARs.
 * 
 * All of this combines to mean that we need the logging implementations that have optional dependencies
 * to be loaded by the Ant classloader, rather than the plugin classloader - so we need them in this source
 * JAR rather than the main plugin JAR.
 * <p>
 * At least this is my best understanding of the issue at this time :)
